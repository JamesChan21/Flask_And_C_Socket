Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.[3] It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more frequently than the core Flask program.[4]

Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest,[5] LinkedIn,[6] and the community web page for Flask itself.[7]

History
Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo, an international group of Python enthusiasts formed in 2004.[8] According to Ronacher, the idea was originally an April Fool's joke that was popular enough to make into a serious application.[9][10][11]

When Ronacher and Georg Brandl created[when?] a bulletin board system written in Python, the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja were developed.[12]

Despite the lack of a major release, Flask has become popular among Python enthusiasts. As of mid 2016, it was the most popular Python web development framework on GitHub,[13][failed verification] and was voted the most popular framework in the Python Developers Survey 2018.[14]

Components
The microframework Flask is based on the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja2.

Werkzeug
Werkzeug is a utility library for the Python programming language, in other words a toolkit for Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) applications, and is licensed under a BSD License. Werkzeug can realize software objects for request, response, and utility functions. It can be used to build a custom software framework on top of it and supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3.[15]

Jinja
Main article: Jinja (template engine)
Jinja, also by Ronacher, is a template engine for the Python programming language and is licensed under a BSD License. Similar to the Django web framework, it provides that templates are evaluated in a sandbox.

Features
Contains development server and debugger
Integrated support for unit testing
RESTful request dispatching
Uses Jinja2 templating
Support for secure cookies (client side sessions)
100% WSGI 1.0 compliant
Unicode-based
Extensive documentation
Google App Engine compatibility
Extensions available to enhance features desired
Example
The following code shows a simple web application that displays "Hello World!" when visited:

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
